## Azure SAS token generator [ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ] [![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/feross/standard)
> A simple Azure SAS token generator


The current project is about how to programmatically generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token to use with Postman in order to post messages to Azure Service Bus Topic/Queue.

## Motivation
After googling for a while in order to generate the necessary token, to post messages to Azure service bus, i noticed that there is no clear explanations, how to ahieve it in JavaScript!!
I'm proud to offer you a simple JS way to generate Azure SAS token - using node - or angular.

## Features
It contains two folders:
 - nodeJS: a simple node application to generate a token using your IDE
 - angular: an angular form allowing to generate a token based on the parameters filled in.

If you prefer a simplier way to get fastly a token, you could use my angular application azure-sas-token from here:
https://ah584d.github.io/azure-sas-token/

This is the same application of the 'angular' folder.

Don't forget to let me a Start :-)
 
## How to use?
[angular version]: you can use the online version, or to checkout the repository and run it locally on your computer

[node version]: only by adding the dependency to your code, see example section

## Screenshots
The application is totally safe, nothing is saved on third party, no request is sent outside, everything is handled in JS browser side

For those who still hesitate, you can checkout the code and run it locally on your computer

```sh
npm run start
```

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

For node
```sh
npm install utf8
```

For angular
```sh
cd azure-sas-token/angular
npm install -d
```
